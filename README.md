## What is Feature Engineering?
- Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones.

- It's the act of extracting important features from raw data and transforming them into formats that are suitable for machine learning.

- A data scientist combines domain knowledge with maths and programming skills to transform or come up with new features that will help a ML model perform better.

## To improve model performance for 3 Big Reasons: 
- We can isolate and highlight key information, which helps the algorithm focus on what is important.

- We can bring in our own domain of expertise.

- Once we understand the vocabulary of feature engineering, we can bring in other people's domain expertise!

## How do we perform feature engineering?
1) Removing unnecessary columns from the dataset.

2) Decomposing date and time features.

3) Decomposing categorical features.

4) Binning numerical features.

5) Aggregating features.
